I performed a comprehensive sales analysis for a company using Power BI. The analysis was based on data from multiple tables, including Customers, Orders, Products, and Suppliers.


Key steps included:

  - Data Modeling: I established relationships between the tables and created a unified data model to enable accurate analysis and insights.
  - Data Visualization: I designed interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to visualize key sales metrics and trends.
  - DAX Calculations: I utilized DAX to create calculated columns and measures, enabling advanced calculations and performance analysis.
